If you want to report any bugs or suggest new chapters and make sure they aren't
forgotten, use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/blocksds/sdk/issues)
of BlocksDS.

If you prefer to chat with other developers in real time, the best way is to
join the gbadev Discord server, where we hang out. This is a community of GBA
game developers, and it has a small section for NDS developent. The NDS is in
many ways an upgraded GBA, so most of the discussions about the GBA are still
useful.

Note that there aren't any Discord invitations here because they sometimes
change. You can find the invitation [in this link](https://gbadev.net).

If you don't like Discord, or you can't use it for some reason, most of the
channels in the gbadev discord are bridged to IRC. For more information, check
[this link](https://gbadev.net/chat.html).
